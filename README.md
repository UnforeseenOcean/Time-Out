# Time-Out
TIME OUT is a language where the action of the program occurs between the lines of code. 

The interpreter cycles through every command; the code tells it how long to wait, thereby skipping over those commands we don't want to fire. If other processes (or a slow browser) cause the "time out" to last too long, we might miss the command we want and execute a different one. 

STILL IN PROGRESS
